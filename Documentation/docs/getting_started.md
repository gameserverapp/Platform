## Ways to connect with GSA

You can currently connect with GSA in two ways:

### DediConnect

DediConnect is the autopilot for dedicated root machines and game servers. It’s incredibly easy to set up and requires zero technical experience.

### RconConnect

RconConnect is designed for self-hosted or rented game servers. It gives you control and visibility, while allowing access to most of GSA’s tools.
