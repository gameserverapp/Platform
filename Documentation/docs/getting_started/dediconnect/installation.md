## Prepare a Windows machine

:::warning WINDOWS ONLY
These steps are for Windows only. For Linux machines, [continue here](#connect-with-dediconnect).
:::

Before a Windows machine can connect with DediConnect, it must run a script to update the system and prepare it for hosting game servers. If you're using a non-Windows machine, skip ahead to the "Connect with DediConnect" section.

### 1. Login with RDP

Use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to access your dedicated machine using the `Administrator` account and the password from your hosting provider.

:::info `Administrator` user required
If your machine doesnâ€™t have an `Administrator` account, [learn how to activate it >](/getting_started/dediconnect/installation#activate-administrator-user-on-windows)
:::

### 2. Open "PowerShell"

Click the `Windows Start` button, type `PowerShell`, then hit `Enter`.

### 3. Run command in PowerShell

Copy the appropriate command for your OS, paste it into PowerShell, and press `Enter`. The script will run and automatically restart your machine when finished.

##### Windows Server 2019

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gameserverapp/Platform/main/Downloads/DediConnect/install-script_windows-server-2022.ps1 -OutFile .\install-script.ps1; .\install-script.ps1
```

:::warning Wait for reboot
Let the script complete fully, this might take up to 30 minutes. **Donâ€™t** close the PowerShell window. 
Wait for the machine to reboot. This could take up to 30 minutes.

## Connect with DediConnect

:::caution before you begin
Make sure your machine runs a [supported OS](/getting_started/dediconnect/requirements) and meets all [requirements](/getting_started/dediconnect/requirements).  
Windows machines must first [run the GSA install script](/getting_started/dediconnect/installation#prepare-a-windows-machine)!
:::

You can add a new machine from the [machine overview page](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/machine) or by clicking the <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-plus-square" size="lg" /> next to `Machines`.
