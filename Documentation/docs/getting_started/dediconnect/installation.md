## Prepare a Windows machine

:::warning WINDOWS ONLY
These steps are for Windows only. For Linux machines, [continue here](#connect-with-dediconnect).
:::

Before a Windows machine can connect with DediConnect, it must first run a script that will update the machine and prepare it for hosting game servers. If you are running a non-Windows machine, skip to the "Connect with Dediconnect" Section.

### 1. Login with RDP
Use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to login on your dedicated machine using the `Administrator` account and the password you received from your hosting provider.

:::info `Administrator` user required
Did your machine come without a `Administrator` user account?
