### Transfer dashboard ownership
Dashboards ownership can be transferred to a different team member. When transferring ownership, the current owner will lose all rights to the dashboard. This is a permanent change.

Transferring ownership will revoke all created API keys for the dashboard. 

:::caution
Ownership transfers are only available for dashboards with an active add-on.
