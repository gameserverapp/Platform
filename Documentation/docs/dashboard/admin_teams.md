### Transfer dashboard ownership

You can transfer ownership of the dashboard to another team member. Please note that the current owner will lose all rights to the dashboard, and the change is permanent.

All API keys created under the original owner will be revoked upon transfer.

:::caution
Dashboard ownership transfer is only available for dashboards with an active add-on.
