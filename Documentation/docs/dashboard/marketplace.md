## Browsing

The marketplace is organized into various categories, including:

- Blueprints
- Tasks
- Shop packs
- Supporter Tiers

![Marketplace - browse marketplace](/img/dashboard/marketplace/marketplace_category_example.jpg)

When you click on a marketplace item, you'll be able to view additional information such as:

- The author
- Number of downloads
- Version details and information for each version

If you spot an item that might violate the terms, you can report it.

## Downloading Items

Most marketplace items can be downloaded to your dashboard, provided your account has the [appropriate permissions](/dashboard/admin_teams#team-permissions).

Each time you download an item, a new copy will be added to your dashboard. For instance, if you download the same item five times, you'll have five separate copies on your dashboard.

After downloading, make sure to check the item. Some items may require additional configuration to work properly on your dashboard. Refer to the marketplace item description for any setup instructions.

### 3. Add a Version

After entering the information, you can add a version. Each version creates a separate copy of the group you uploaded. This allows you to update the group on your dashboard without modifying the marketplace item.

Enter a version number and (optionally) provide a changelog to explain what was added or changed.
