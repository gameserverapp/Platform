## Browsing
The marketplace has various categories, like:

- Tasks
- Shop packs
- Supporter Tiers

![Marketplace - browse marketplace](/img/dashboard/marketplace/marketplace_category_example.jpg)

After clicking a marketplace item, you can see more information like:
- The author
- Number of downloads
- Versions & info per version

If you come across a marketplace item that might violate the terms, you can report it.

## Download item

You can download most marketplace items to your dashboard, assuming your account has the [appropriate permissions](/dashboard/admin_teams#team-permissions).

Each time you download a marketplace item, a new copy is downloaded to your dashboard. When you download it 5 times, you will have 5 separate copies on your dashboard.

Make sure to check the downloaded item after downloading. Some items may require some configuration before they can operate on your dashboard. Check the marketplace item description for instructions.

## Publish

These steps explain how you can publish something to the marketplace. 

:::info Blueprints
For blueprints the publishing approach is different. See the [blueprint marketplace section >](/blueprints/how-to/publish_blueprint_on_marketplace)
:::

### 1. Submit to marketplace
Things like Task, Shop pack and Supporter Tier groups can be added to the marketplace.
You can either submit it to the marketplace via the Group page, or by navigating to the marketplace and clicking the `+add` button there.

Group page example:

### 2. Enter information
Before the new marketplace item can be published to the marketplace, you first need to enter a name, summary, description and image.

![Marketplace - Publish to marketplace - enter info](/img/dashboard/marketplace/publish_to_marketplace_2.jpg)

### 3. Add a version
After entering the info fields, you can add a version. Each version creates a copy of the group you uploaded.
Once uploaded, you can change the group on your dashboard without changing the marketplace item. 

![Marketplace - Publish to marketplace - add version](/img/dashboard/marketplace/publish_to_marketplace_3.jpg)

Enter a `version` number and (optionally) an explanation about what you added / changed in the `changelog`.

### 4. Marketplace nickname & terms
If this is your first marketplace item, you need to accept the marketplace terms and set a nickname. This nickname is visible to all dashboard users.
