DediConnect can install various services on your machine. These services are optional and are usually required by game servers, like needing a MySQL database to store data.

## How to install a service

Navigate to the machine settings and click the `Actions` button in the __top-right corner__ and then click `Install service`.

[Go to Machines >](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/machine)

## Available services

### MySQL / MariaDB
DediConnect installs MariaDB, which is a MySQL drop-in replacement with generally better performance and support.

Beside the general connection information for the main database can you also find the `root` account information + examples for plugin settings.

### Syncthing
With Syncthing you can synchronize [`cluster` data](/dashboard/machines/practical_info#directories--folders), which is required for games like [ARK: Survival Evolved to support Cross ARK travel](/dashboard/game_servers/game_specific/ark_survival_evolved).

For optimal performance we recommend each machine is connected with every other machine. In the example below we sync 2 machines. Repeat the steps if you have more machines.

#### 1. Install Syncthing & open settings url
Install Syncthing on all machines that need to be synchronized. When the service finished installing, head over to the `Settings` page and open the Syncthing URL for all Syncthing services you installed.

#### 2. Find & copy Syncthing ID for machine A
In the Syncthing interface, hit `Actions` and `Show ID`.

#### 3. Add Syncthing ID to machine B

On Machine B click "Add remote device" and paste the ID (the one you copied from machine A) in here. __Do NOT click Save yet.__

Navigate to the `Sharing` tab and activate `backup` and `cluster`. Then hit `Save`.

#### 4. Confirm on machine A
Now go back to the Syncthing interface on Machine A. After a short while a confirmation window will show up. This will ask you to confirm that you want to connect with Machine B.
__Do not add any device that you do not recognise__.

#### 5. Confirm sharing folders
After confirming to connect with Machine B, Syncthing will ask to confirm sharing the "backup" and "cluster" folder. Click "Share" for both.

#### 6. Ready!
Verify all `Remote devices` are connected.

Rename services or move them to a different cluster.

Settings specific to services are also listed on the `Settings` page. See [available services](#available-services) for more information.
