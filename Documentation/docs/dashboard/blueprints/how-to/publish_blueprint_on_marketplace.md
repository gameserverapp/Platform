Learn how to publish a blueprint on the [marketplace](/dashboard/marketplace) and share it with the GSA community.

## Intro

For this guide, we assume you have already [created a blueprint](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints) and ensured it is working properly.

:::info
Make sure you only publish your own work on the marketplace, or have permission to publish the work of others (such as through an open-source license). Always give appropriate credit to the original author.

## Publish Blueprint

To publish on the marketplace, your GSA account must have made at least one (add-on) purchase. This requirement helps prevent spam on the platform.

### 1. Marketplace Checklist

Open the blueprint's `Settings` page and locate the `Marketplace checklist`. This checklist will guide you through the required steps for publishing.

### 2. Set Up Summary, Image, etc.

Provide a clear and engaging summary, description, and image so users can quickly understand the purpose and content of your blueprint.

#### 2.1 Summary

The summary is what users see first when browsing the [Blueprint Marketplace](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/marketplace/market/blueprint).

![Blueprint - Publish on marketplace - Blueprint summary](/img/dashboard/blueprint/publish_on_marketplace/marketplace_summary.jpg)

Here’s how your summary appears in the marketplace list:

#### 2.2 Description

Use the description field to explain the blueprint in more detail. Include relevant references, setup information, and other important notes.

#### 2.3 Image

Upload a blueprint image. It will be shown next to your summary and above the description in the marketplace listing.

### 3. Publish Version

Only blueprint versions marked as `Published` will appear on the marketplace. If a version is still in DEV mode, it won’t be visible to others.\

You must publish at least one version before the blueprint itself can be published.\

## Publish New Version

After [creating a new blueprint version](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints#add-version) and testing it, you can publish that version to the marketplace.

Select the version you want to publish, then click `Publish now`.
