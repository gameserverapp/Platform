Learn how to publish a blueprint on the marketplace and share it with the GSA community.

## Intro

For this guide, we assume you have already [created a blueprint](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints) and ensured it is working properly.

:::info
Make sure you only publish your own work on the marketplace, or have permission to publish the work of others (through an open-source license, for example) and give appropriate credit to the author.

## Publish Blueprint

To publish something on the marketplace, you need a GSA account that has made at least one (add-on) purchase. This requirement helps us reduce spam on the marketplace.

### 1. Marketplace Checklist

You can find the `Marketplace checklist` on the blueprint `Settings` page. The checklist helps you prepare the blueprint for publishing.

### 2. Set Up Summary, Image, etc.

Enter a summary, description, and image to help people understand what your blueprint is about.

#### 2.1 Summary

The summary is the first thing people see when browsing the [Blueprint Marketplace](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/marketplace/market/blueprint).

### 3. Publish Version

Only `Published` blueprint versions are visible on the marketplace. Newly created blueprint versions (DEV mode) won't be visible. [Learn more about blueprint version states >](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints#version-state)

You must have at least one published version before you can publish the blueprint on the marketplace.\
