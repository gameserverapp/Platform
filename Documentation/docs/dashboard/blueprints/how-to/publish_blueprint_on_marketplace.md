#### Publish to marketplace
After clicking `Publish now`, the blueprint version will not automatically show up on the marketplace.\
To have your blueprint show up on the marketplace, you first need to [submit the blueprint to the marketplace](/dashboard/blueprints/getting_started#publish-on-marketplace).

When your blueprint was published on the marketplace, only the `published` versions will be visible there.
