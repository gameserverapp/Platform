title: Create LinuxGSM Blueprint
sidebar_position: 4
---

This guide will help you create a blueprint using the [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/) template. In this example, we'll create a blueprint for [Left 4 Dead 2](https://linuxgsm.com/servers/l4d2server/) using the [LinuxGSM Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/gameservermanagers/gameserver).

:::warning Work in Progress
This section is currently being developed.

## Intro

This guide assumes you have already [created a blueprint](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints#create-a-blueprint) and are currently on [the `Add version` page](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints#add-version).

:::caution Use `LinuxGSM` Template
For this guide, we used the `LinuxGSM` blueprint template. It is recommended to use a template to ensure most fields are pre-filled.

:::

## 1. Save Generated Blueprint

GameServerApp will automatically fill in all the necessary fields for the LinuxGSM blueprint. All you need to do is save the blueprint.

## 2. Launch a Fresh Server with the Blueprint

Go to the [Install New Game Server page](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/order/gameserver/machine) and launch a new game server using the blueprint you just created.

![Blueprint - Create LinuxGSM blueprint - Launch new game server](/img/dashboard/blueprint/create_linuxgsm_blueprint/launch_server.jpg)

Click `Install game server now` and wait for the installation process to complete.

### 2.1 First Launch

Once the installation is complete, launch the game server without making any changes to its settings.

:::caution Install During First Start
LinuxGSM downloads the game server files on the first boot, so the initial startup will take some time. Allow the game server at least 5-10 minutes to boot up and complete the setup.
:::

### 2.2 Follow Installation Progress

You can monitor the LinuxGSM game server installation progress in the Docker container logs.

![Blueprint - Create LinuxGSM blueprint - See installation progress](/img/dashboard/blueprint/create_linuxgsm_blueprint/follow_install_progress.jpg)

Wait until you see a log message indicating that the installation is complete.

## 3. Fix Port Settings

The ports configured by LinuxGSM in the `LinuxGSM config file` may need adjustment to ensure the game server appears correctly on the dashboard. This issue arises because LinuxGSM variables are applied differently depending on the game, so some tweaking may be required.

Below you can see an example of the memory usage sitting at `0.65 GB`, but the game server is showing as `Offline (loading...)`, this usually indicates a port configuration issue.

To resolve this, navigate to the Config template for the game server youâ€™re working on and adjust the ports (swap the variables). After saving the Config template, restart the game server.

## 4. Hooray!

If all goes well, your game server should now be online and ready for you to join.

:::tip Finalize Blueprint Settings
To configure additional settings like uptime monitoring, RCON, and backups, visit the [blueprint form section >](/dashboard/blueprints/create_and_manage_blueprints#blueprint-form).
