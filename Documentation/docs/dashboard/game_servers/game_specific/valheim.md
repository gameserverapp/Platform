## Known issues

When you add Steam IDs to the whitelist, Valheim will automatically ban any player not on the list.  
There is no toggle to enable or disable this behavior. If you don’t want the whitelist active, simply remove all Steam IDs from the whitelist.

## Connecting to the game server

Valheim can sometimes struggle to locate or connect to game servers.  
The most reliable way to connect is:  
**Join Game** → **Join IP** → enter `IP:GAME_PORT`.
