![Game server - overview](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_overview.jpg)

:::info Locating the `Game server ID`
When contacting support, always include the `game server ID`. You can find it in the __top-right corner__ on the game server settings page.

![Game server ID](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_id.jpg)
:::

## Controls
You can start, stop, and update your game servers from multiple sections. This makes it easy to manage all servers on a particular machine at once.

![Game server - update modal example](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_control_modal.jpg)

### Game server settings
Manage individual servers directly from the settings page. You can start, shut down, restart, or update the game server.

#### Perform manual index
This indexes all players and groups on the server. Use this when you've added a new game server and want to sync data.

#### Clone game server
Clone most settings to a new server. After cloning, the server isn't installed yet. Go to the "Your old game servers" section on the [Cluster overview](/dashboard/game_servers/clusters) and click `Install` for the cloned server.

### General

![Game server - settings - basic](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_settings_basic.jpg)

#### Config template
Switch to a different [Config template](/dashboard/game_servers/config_templates) here.

:::tip
You can [automate switching templates](/dashboard/automate_tasks/actions#game-server-actions) via Tasks.
:::

##### Blueprint alert
If the server and template use different blueprints, you'll see a warning. It's not required to match them, but large differences may cause problems.

![Blueprint alert](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_settings_basic_blueprint_different.jpg)

#### Map
Choose a preset map or enter a custom map name by selecting `Custom map`.

![Game server - custom map](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_custom_map.jpg)

:::tip

:::

#### Cluster
You can only change clusters when the server is shut down.

#### Slots
Change the player slot limit to a value supported by the game. Using too many slots may cause issues in some games.

#### In-game admin password
Each server gets a unique password automatically. This removes the need to hardcode passwords in config templates, improving security.

### Automation
Configure automation per server or globally via the [Config template settings](/dashboard/game_servers/config_templates#settings). Global settings are labeled `Inherited`.

![Game server - settings - automation](/img/dashboard/gameserver/getting_started/gameserver_settings_automation.jpg)

#### Update on start
Automatically updates the server on startup. Best used on test servers.

:::caution Test servers only
Using this on live servers increases startup time and is not recommended unless auto-updates are disabled.
:::

#### Auto-update
Set whether the server auto-updates and the countdown timer duration.

#### Auto-restart
Schedule automatic restarts to maintain performance.

:::tip Scheduled task
For more advanced schedules, use a [scheduled Task](/dashboard/automate_tasks/getting_started#scheduled).
