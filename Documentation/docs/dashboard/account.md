### Default Dashboard

When you log in, GSA will automatically open your default dashboard for quicker access.

### Create Dashboard

You can create new dashboards for starting a fresh community or testing features. Demo dashboards are also available, these include dummy data and are automatically deleted after a limited time.

### Leave Dashboard

If you’ve been invited to a dashboard, you can leave it at any time. Dashboards that you personally created cannot be left.

## Personalize

### Nickname & Timezone

Your nickname appears to other admin team members and is visible in areas like the activity log. Setting the correct timezone ensures that all times and dates across the dashboard are shown accurately.
