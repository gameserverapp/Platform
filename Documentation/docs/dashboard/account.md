### Default Dashboard

When you log into the dashboard, GSA will automatically switch to your default dashboard.

### Create Dashboard

Create new dashboards for testing or starting new communities. You can also create demo dashboards.

Demo dashboards contain dummy data and will automatically be deleted after a set time.

### Leave Dashboard

You can leave any dashboard you were invited to. However, dashboards you created yourself cannot currently be left.

## Personalize

### Nickname & Timezone

Your nickname is visible to other admin team members and is shown in places like the activity log. Set your correct timezone so all times and dates on the dashboard are shown accurately.
