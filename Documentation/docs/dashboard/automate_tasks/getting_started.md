## Settings

![Automations / Tasks - Task settings](/img/dashboard/automate_tasks/task_settings.jpg)

### Activate automation

Turn on the `Automation is active` toggle to enable the task.

### Run for each game server(s)

Decide if the task should run per game server or independently. For tasks like Discord messages, you can disable this setting.

#### Select clusters / game servers

If `Run for each game server(s)` is enabled, you must choose which cluster(s) or server(s) the task will run on.

#### Only run when game server is online

By default, tasks only run when the game server is online. You can disable this to allow execution even if a server is offline.

#### Delay between servers

Add a delay between executions on each server to reduce load.

Options:
- No delay
- 20 seconds
- 40 seconds

### Run actions when player is online

When enabled, actions will wait for the player to be online before executing. This helps avoid issues with actions (e.g. commands) that donâ€™t support offline use. You can disable this if the action does not require a player to be online.

:::caution
Most games do not allow commands to be run on offline players.
