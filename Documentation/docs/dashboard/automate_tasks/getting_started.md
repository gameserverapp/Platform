## Settings

![Automations / Tasks - Task settings](/img/dashboard/automate_tasks/task_settings.jpg)

### Activate automation
Activate the `Automation is active` switch to enable the automation.

### Run for each game server(s)
Scheduled tasks can run per server or independent of any game servers. For example when you only need to send a message to Discord, you can turn this option off.


#### Select clusters / game servers
When `Run for each game server(s)` is active you must select one or more cluster(s) and/or game server(s).

#### Only run when game server is online
By default tasks will only run for game servers that are online. If available you can disable the switch to let tasks also run for offline game servers.

#### Delay between servers
Adds delay between each game server task, in order to spread load when running on many game servers.

Options:
- No delay
- 20 second delay
- 40 second delay

### Run actions when player is online
When enabled this setting will ensure the actions wait for the player to come online before running. This avoids issues with actions (commands for example) that do not support offline delivery. Can be turned off for actions that don't depend on the player being online.

:::caution
Most games do not support running commands for players that are not online.
