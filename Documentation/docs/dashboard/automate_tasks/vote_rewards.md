## Setup vote site

### 1. Register game server with sites
To begin you need register your game server with one of the supported vote sites. All sites require game servers to register in order to receive a special API key, which GSA uses to check whether players voted.

The registration process is different per vote site. Contact the vote site for more information how to get an API key from their site to work with GSA vote rewards.

### 2. Enter vote site API key
Copy the API key from the vote site for the game server you want to set up.

:::caution
Each server should have a unique key. Do not reuse the API key for multiple game servers.
:::

![Automations / Tasks - Vote site API key setup](/img/dashboard/automate_tasks/vote_reward/vote_site_api_key.jpg)

Enter the API key on the GSA vote site settings page for the right game server and click `Save settings`.

### 3. Done!
GSA validates new API keys after saving. You may need to reload the page to see whether it was validated.

## Create vote reward
There are 2 options to automatically reward players for voting on the game servers. The easiest and most straight forward method is using the Vote reward option. With Tasks you can create more flexible vote rewards. 

### Task
Create a [Trigger task](/dashboard/automate_tasks/getting_started#create-automation--task) and select `Player voted` or `Player voted [X] times [Since]` as the condition.

[Add actions to the task](/dashboard/automate_tasks/getting_started#3-add-actions) to reward the player.
