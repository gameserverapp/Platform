## Shop pack types
There are 2 kind of Shop pack types:

### Single
The `Single` type Shop pack involves a single package (as the name implies). There are no sub packages for `Single` Shop packs. 

:::tip
You can add existing `Single` packs to a `Collection`.

### Collection
Group packages from the same category or with different quantities in `Collections`. `Collections` let you create sub packages that can be purchased separately.

- Disable package when bought by someone (single purchase limit)

:::info single purchase

:::

[Learn how to reset purchase limits >](/dashboard/monetization/deliveries#reset-purchase-limits)

![Monetization - Settings - Purchase limits](/img/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs/settings_purchase_limits.jpg)

### Visibility
Determine who can see the Shop pack / sub package. Can be used to create Shop packs that are only visible to players with a specific [Custom Role](/dashboard/admin_tools/custom_roles) (VIPs for example).

Hiding packages can be useful in cases where you want to create a package to recover in-game items or to send items to admins using [manual delivery](#manual-delivery), but you don't want players being able to purchase the package.

![Monetization - Settings - Visibility](/img/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs/settings_visibility.jpg)

### Offline delivery
With `offline delivery` the actions will execute regardless of the buyer's in-game status (no character online for the buyer).

This can be useful for Shop packs / sub packages that grant whitelist access, for example. In those cases the player can't join the server until they are whitelisted.

:::caution
Most in-game commands do require the player to be online. Make sure to test Shop packs thoroughly when using `Support offline delivery`.
:::

![Monetization - Settings - Offline delivery](/img/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs/settings_offline_delivery.jpg)

### Character level (min/max)
Require the buyer's character to be above or below a certain in-game level.

Setting a min/max level can be useful for starter packs or advanced packs that should only be available for high level characters.

![Monetization - Settings - Character level](/img/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs/settings_char_level.jpg)

### Delivery restrictions
Limit Shop packs / sub packages to specific clusters or game servers.

In addition to limiting is it also possible to prohibit delivery on specific game servers. This allows you to restrict a package to a specific cluster but rule out certain servers in that cluster.

![Monetization - Settings - Delivery restrictions](/img/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs/settings_delivery_restrictions.jpg)

### Images
Set up an image for the Shop pack / sub package.

#### Website image
