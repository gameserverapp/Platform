:::

#### 2. Run via dashboard

Use the `RCON` popup from the [shortcut menu](/#shortcut-menu) to test the command via the dashboard.

Ensure that you're using a valid ID, variables are not allowed here.

#### 3. Check the ID / Variable

Many games require a player/Steam ID or character ID for commands.

Double-check the variables used. Refer to the variable list and test with different IDs.
