### 3. Add Actions
Go to the `Delivery content` tab to add actions. These actions will be executed when players buy the Supporter Tier. If the tier is a `recurring` subscription, the actions in `Delivery content` will execute each time the subscription is successfully renewed.

The actions function similarly to Task actions. [Learn more about available actions >](/dashboard/automate_tasks/actions).

### 4. Expired Actions

:::caution
This step applies only to recurring subscriptions.
:::

When a recurring subscription expires, all actions in the `Expired actions` tab are triggered. These actions allow you to remove any roles, whitelist access, or other perks when the subscription ends.

The actions here are similar to Task actions. [Learn more about the available actions >](/dashboard/automate_tasks/actions).
