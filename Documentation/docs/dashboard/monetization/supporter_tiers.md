### 3. Add Actions

Switch to the `Delivery content` tab to define actions that are triggered when a player purchases the tier.  
For recurring subscriptions, these actions will run each time the subscription is renewed.

Actions work similarly to Task actions. [Learn more about available actions >](/dashboard/automate_tasks/actions)

### 4. Expired Actions

:::caution
This step applies only to recurring subscriptions.
:::

When a recurring subscription ends, the actions in the `Expired actions` tab are triggered. This lets you revoke roles, remove access, or disable perks.

These actions also function like Task actions. [Learn more about available actions >](/dashboard/automate_tasks/actions)
