Custom Roles can be used in various features across the dashboard. Most communities use them to give VIP players special perks, but they’re also useful for setting up advanced task automation.

## Discounts

You can offer exclusive [Supporter Tier](/dashboard/monetization/supporter_tiers) or [Shop pack](/dashboard/monetization/shop_packs) discounts to players with a Custom Role. This is a great way to reward VIPs with reduced prices in the in-game shop.
