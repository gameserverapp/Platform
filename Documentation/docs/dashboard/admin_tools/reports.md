### Assign to Me
Before you begin handling a report, make sure to assign it to yourself. This helps avoid duplication by letting other team members know that you're already working on it.

## Report Details
Each report provides complete details about the person who submitted it and, if applicable, the player being reported. If the report was submitted through the in-game form, the playerâ€™s exact in-game location is also logged.

You can leave notes on the report to share progress and updates with the rest of the team.

### Log to Discord
Automatically post a message in a designated Discord channel when a new report is submitted.
